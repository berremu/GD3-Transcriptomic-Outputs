# GD3-Transcriptomic-Outputs
The repository is organized to include both raw and processed data, as well as intermediate results such as pathway gene sets, biomarker intersections, and drug prediction outcomes. The aim is to ensure full transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of the analytical pipeline applied in the study.
 
# Repository Structure
GEO2R_outputs/
Contains original output files (.tsv) from GEO2R analysis of dataset GSE21899 for GD1 vs Control and GD3 vs Control comparisons.

Filtered_DEGs/
Curated and threshold-filtered DEG lists (adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 0.585) used in all downstream analyses.

WP2004_pathway_data/
Includes gene sets retrieved from WikiPathways (WP2004: miRNA targeted genes in lymphocytes), in .tsv and .xlsx formats.

Intersection_and_Biomarkers/
Files showing overlapping genes between GD3-specific DEGs and the WP2004 pathway. Includes biomarker classification as upregulated or downregulated.

Drug_Repositioning/
Results obtained from the L1000CDS² platform based on GD3-specific biomarkers. File includes ranked compounds and metadata.

Cytoscape Regulatory Network Files
This folder includes the Cytoscape-related data files used in the construction and analysis of the multifactorial regulatory network for Gaucher Disease Type 3 (GD3):

cytoscape multifactoriel.xlsx:
This Excel file contains the core interaction matrix used to visualize regulatory relationships among transcription factors, miRNAs, proteins, and GD3-specific biomarkers. It served as the input table for network construction in Cytoscape.

betw.csv:
Output file generated by the cytoHubba plugin in Cytoscape using the Betweenness Centrality algorithm. It ranks nodes based on their bridging capacity within the network, highlighting elements that may control communication between modules.

degree.csv:
Another output from cytoHubba, listing nodes ranked by Degree Centrality, which measures the number of direct connections each node has. It helps identify hub regulators with potentially broad influence across the transcriptomic network.
